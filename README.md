## 🚀 About Me

🎓 I’m currently learning **Front-End Web Development** at [ALX](https://www.alxafrica.com/software-engineering/), building solid foundations in **HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React**.

💡 I started learning software engineering because I love **creating beautiful, interactive digital experiences** that solve real-world problems. My background in design and healthcare gives me a unique edge in **empathy, user-centered thinking, and creative problem solving**.

🎯 **My Vision**: To become a developer who builds tools and interfaces that are both **functional and emotionally engaging**. I believe the future of the web lies in blending design with performance, and I want to be at the forefront of that.

💻 **What I want to build**:  
I would love to work on:
- 🌍 Real-world, user-friendly web apps that solve local or global challenges.
- 🛠️ Open-source UI libraries or design systems.
- 🧠 Tools that empower learning, health, and personal productivity.
